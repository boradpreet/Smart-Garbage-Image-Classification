* Waste management remains a persistent and critical issue across the globe, with increasing urbanization and consumerism contributing to the generation of massive amounts of mixed waste. Traditional methods of manual garbage segregation are labor-intensive, inefficient, and pose health risks to workers. Moreover, improper sorting of waste materials significantly hampers recycling processes and increases environmental pollution. To address these challenges, we propose an AI-powered Garbage Image Classification system that uses deep learning to automatically identify and categorize different types of waste such as plastic, glass, metal, cardboard, paper, and trash. This solution enables real-time waste classification by simply analyzing images captured from mobile devices, surveillance cameras, or smart bins. By integrating this technology into waste collection systems or public recycling initiatives, municipalities and private sectors can streamline waste segregation, reduce operational costs, and improve recycling efficiency. The model, trained on diverse garbage images, is highly accurate and easily deployable via web or mobile applications, making it a scalable and impactful solution for smart cities, recycling plants, environmental startups, and educational campaigns focused on sustainability. Ultimately, this system empowers organizations to adopt cleaner, smarter, and safer waste management practices using AI.
